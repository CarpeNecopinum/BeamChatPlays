5. Go to beam.pro and set up your interactive board with the buttons and control you need for your game. <br>

7. Now, go back to the folder for this app that you unzipped and open up the settings folder. <br>
8. Edit auth.json with your beam information. <br>
9. Next go back to the root folder and go to the controls folder. <br>
